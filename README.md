# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This version of my portfolio was built shortly after my Basic-Portfolio. It includes much of the same information - projects, links to social media, etc. - but was styled using Bootstrap, with only minor adjustments. This page is responsive, and used HTML and CSS.

Check it out, and let me know what you think!
